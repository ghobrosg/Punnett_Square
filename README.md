# Punnett_Square

This program is a Punnett Square solver. According to Wikipedia, the Punnett square is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment. I learnt about Punnett Squares in my biology class and I had an idea about making a program which can solve them for me. In this program, the user will enter the alleles of both parents and then the program will output the resulting Punnett Square. I used the iomanip library and the setw() method in order to create the diagram.
